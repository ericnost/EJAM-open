Will make a PR when generic branch is reviewed","For some tasks, arrow queries can work much faster than data.table operations. We want to identify functions where we use arrow datasets already that may benefit from speedups. Start by looking in functions that call `dataload_from_pins` within them - see attached list [scripts_with_dataload_from_pins.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18675055/scripts_with_dataload_from_pins.txt)

Typically this involves two steps: 
1. reading an arrow file in with `as_data_frame = FALSE`. we now can do this on development through `dataload_from_pins('dataset', return_data_table = FALSE)`
2. applying dplyr's `filter, mutate, select` operations followed by `dplyr::collect()` - see more info here: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/data_wrangling.html

Example for site selection: `frs_from_naics`

```
## loads frs dataset
dataload_from_pins('frs')
## loads frs_arrow dataset
dataload_from_pins('frs', return_data_table = FALSE)

2. If a branch appears outdated but actually still has useful work on it that was never merged into dev, it should be updated from development and conflicts resolved and either turned into a PR or at least further worked on or noted as being on hold, etc.
 
Attached are 2 screenshots that show a long list of branches and how many commits they are behind and/or ahead of the development branch.

- About 25 branches are hundreds of commits behind development branch, suggesting they have not been worked on for a very long time and may be obsolete or need to be updated/ revived. 
- About 9 branches (as of 1/22/25) that seem to have zero commits ahead of development branch, suggesting they were already merged in but not yet deleted. 
- Another 11 branches are 1 commit ahead of development, so some of those are probably obsolete as well.

The existing suite of ejscreenapi-related functions need to be made to handle a shapefile/polygon query of the EJScreen API.

- The web app needs to be able to pull up an EJScreen Report for one polygon when a user clicks the button in the detailed results site by site table. To enable that, see below:
  -  Need to decide what query method works and if url-encoded works. If possible, url-encoded requests for EJScreen API report on polygon would be most consistent with how proximity-based or fips-based EJScreen API reports are obtained. The URL-generating function should create a link to such a report if that is possible (but might not be able to do it via simple url-encoded query, GET vs POST??). If a link can be created that generates such a report, then the results_bysite table output of ejamit, doaggregate, etc. normally have a URL link to EJScreen report - if possible, that should link to such a report for a polygon when appropriate. If it cannot be url-encoded then tabular outputs probably cannot have a working link to polygon-based ejscreenapi report? Same is true for the excel table -- if a link would work, that link needs to be able to pull up an EJScreen Report for one polygon when a user clicks the button in the detailed results site by site table tab. There could be a workaround, possibly, where a unique link is created that does not contain the polygon but somehow is able to use an ID to refer to and obtain the saved or downloadable polygon and then run a report on that via ejscreen api using POST??
  - Need to decide if and how to return the geometry/bounds, not just the tables of numerical results. And how will subsequent functions use that spatial object. Currently it probably just drops the geometry fields returned and/or does not even ask for geometry to be returned?

It is sometimes very confusing when an upload does not seem to work and it is because you forgot to change the selection from latlon to fips, for example. The code should allow you to upload a file of any of those acceptable types and figure out which type it is based on the table headers.

If it is ambiguous, use these rules to prioritize which type to treat it as - The order of priority will be this if more than one type of info is found:
shapefile > latlon > regid > progid > fips

If there is nothing but fips, except there are multiple types of FIPS, like city fips and county fips and state fips, then we probably want to use county but should warn user of the ambiguity.

This priority order makes sense because FIPS of some type may be a column in a latlon or other table, and latlon is more explicit about their preferred location than the id and if they have both then the latlon were probably just taken from the id anyway, and shapefiles if provided are probably what they want to analyze even if it has columns with FIPS or even latlon like centroids for example.

Text like ""Upload a file with lat-long coordinates"" will need to list all the valid types, and ""required files:...."" would need changes too.

The automatic change in default radius if shapefile is picked would have to be triggered after the file upload when server infers what type of data was provided.

We still will need the conditional pulldown called ""How would you like to select categories?"" if they pick ""Select a category...""
We will not in the web app allow uploads of lists of NAICS, SIC, MACT, EPA program type. It would be very unusual for someone to need to analyze more than one or very few codes at once -- too many facilities, too broad. One can continue to manually select multiple ones from the pulldowns if necessary. Or one can use the R functions directly for that.

cc: @sarasoko ","For example, 10k points at 3 miles radius can take >2 minutes to finish as of 10/2024:

This issue is just about warnings/ projections on timing:

- [ ] **create benchmark times** required to do various kinds of analysis while varying a few key parameters: Finish it first for points and then do it for shapefiles. Key params to vary in testing: 
  - Number of places =
    -  100, 300, 1k,  3k, 10k, 30k for testing points 
    - similar for shapefiles
    - FIPS: all counties in 1 moderate sized state, and then all counties in 1 big epa region
  - Size of each place: 
    - radius for latlon (1, 3.1, 6.2 miles, plus maybe 30 miles for just 100 and 300 sites), 
    - avg square meters per polygon (avg sizes of redlined zones PWS service areas, and NPL site boundaries, and then plus 1 mile buffer), and 
    - typical type/size of FIPS (City/CDPs sample, random Counties, random States).

Analysis of points can be benchmarked like this:
```
speedseen_all <- EJAM:::speedtest(
       n = c(100, 300, 1000,  3000, 10000),
       radii = c(1, 3.106856, 6.2, 10), logging = TRUE) 
```
- [ ] **fit a rough formula for projecting how long an analysis will take**, as a function of those key parameters. This probably should be done on the web app first. but should also run in ejamit() to see if times are about the same.
- [ ] **Warning/estimate webapp:** provide a warning/ estimate of about how long it is going to take in shiny web app before it starts, based on prior benchmarks of rate per hour as a function of the key factors
- [ ] **Warning/estimate RStudio**: provide a warning/ estimate of about how long it is going to take in ejamit() before it starts
- [ ] **ETA webapp**: when it starts in shiny app, give estimated time projected completion (ETA) based on the above and start-time. 
- [ ] **ETA RStudio:** when it starts in ejamit(), give estimated time projected completion (ETA) based on the above and start-time. 
- [ ] **Running ETA** while running doaggregate(): Give regular updates on the ETA for just doaggregate(), the predicted time at which it will finish that function, based on the number remaining and the time and the rate for all done in doaggregate() so far. 
- [ ] If possible, incorporate that into the web app if not already communicated adequately.
- [ ] Running ETA while running getbblocksnearby or the related fips and shape functions?  optional if easy but not so useful since it still has to do doaggregate() after that.

- fips_bgs_in_statefips    (and maybe fips_bgs_in_statename and fips_bgs_in_ST ? )

## Also see this repo's list of [ISSUES RELATED TO SPEED/PERFORMANCE](https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22speed%20%2F%20performance%20(see%20%23444)%22) 

## GENERAL STEPS IN TRYING TO SPEED UP A SHINY APP OR R CODE IN GENERAL

**1. Identify/prioritize slow actions _from user point of view_.**

Try using the app (basic steps seem sluggish like maps, short report, knitting, etc.). 
From user's perspective, Why speed is critical: If a site takes longer than 3 seconds to load, 53% of mobile users will abandon the site. If a site takes more than 5 seconds to load, the abandonment rate jumps to 90%. A one-second delay in page load time can lead to a 7% decrease in conversions, a 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and an 11% decrease in page views. 84% of customers will abandon a website or app if they experience slow load times or other performance issues, sources: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qngIJToQxE_LExuqgjXXtoV25z2Ri1uQ/view  

**2. Identify/ prioritize slow, key lines of code.**

 Do profiling of bottlenecks, before optimizing code - find out what key functions or steps are slow. 
 Mostly see `getblocksnearby()` and especially `doaggregate()` in particular. 
 e.g., in doaggregate(), the 1 line of code that does this:  `sites2blocks_overall <- ` is very slow.  
 e.g., in doaggregate(), optimizing percentiles function that looks up what percentile each raw indicator score   (IT IS SLOW)
 - See http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html#improve-perf  (but make sure viewing the latest edition of book!)
 - Use **`EJAM:::speedtest()`,** a wrapper that automates checking multiple radii and counts of points. But note it still relies on system.time({}) which gives a different answer each time and gives only total time overall. Can use it like this: 
```
   speedseen_all <- EJAM:::speedtest(
       n = c(100, 500,  1000, 5000),
       radii = c(1, 3.106856, 5, 10), logging = TRUE)
```
 - ***Use `profvis::profvis()`,*** which provides details on which steps are slow unlike `speedtest()`, but does not automate checking sensitivity to multiple distances and counts of points.
 - ***Use `microbenchmark::microbenchmark()` later***, only to check/ compare timing of tiny chunks of code within a function

**3. Optimize code and app only after profiling - see ideas below.**

**4. Do load testing and optimize server settings and code for load.**

- [Scaling and Performance Tuning in Posit Connect](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/231874748-Scaling-and-Performance-Tuning-in-Posit-Connect)
- see [shinytest2 package](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest2/)  and/or  [shiny::testServer()](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/1.6.0/testserver) They are [compared in this article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2024/08/how-to-write-tests-with-shinytestserver-similar-to-shinytest2/).   and see EJAM branches called dev_shinytest2 or https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM/tree/dev_ejscreen2.3_shinytest2

- see [ShinyProxy vs Posit Connect: Benchmark Test for Scaling Shiny Apps from appsilon.com](https://appsilon.com/shinyproxy-vs-posit-connect/) and optimize further based on that. async methods probably needed when concurrent users. Do load testing and modify code to ensure app is highly responsive under anticipated load.

## TIPS/ TECHNIQUES FOR SPEEDING UP A SHINY APP OR R CODE IN GENERAL
 
Consider strategies such as these (roughly in order of priority or feasibility): 
Again, it is critical to do profiling and load testing to confirm what are bottlenecks, first, before trying to optimize anything!  
 
**SHINY-SPECIFIC: tips, articles and resources on speeding up a shiny app:** 

- https://www.appsilon.com/post/blazing-fast-shiny-apps  **looks very useful as an overview of key points on speed of app**
- see _Mastering Shiny_ [book's chapter on performance](https://mastering-shiny.org/performance.html)
- https://appsilon.com/speeding-up-r-shiny/
- https://appsilon.com/scaling-and-infrastructure-why-is-my-shiny-app-slow/
- https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/04/lessons-learned-with-shiny-benchmark-improving-the-performance-of-a-shiny-dashboard/
- use new **shiny::[ExtendedTask()](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/nonblocking/index.html)** or callR for async work in separate process (see #99 )
- adjust settings on server (number of processes, etc. #231 )
- **Use the new feature, [ExtendedTask()](https://rdrr.io/github/rstudio/shiny/man/ExtendedTask.html)**
- **Use the new feature, [useBusyIndicators()](https://rdrr.io/github/rstudio/shiny/man/useBusyIndicators.html)** to offer spinner/ progress bar where relevant, at least until speed improves.
- **Use  [callr](https://callr.r-lib.org/)**
- Have fast basic elements of webpage/ tab load asap, then slower ones afterwards.
- Remove nonessential features/stats if they are bottlenecks per profiling. 
- Use **reactive** programming optimally - have the minimum of things refresh, like other tabs, using isolate() and bindcache functions, etc., use debouncing of sliders, etc.
- profiling/ testing:
  - do **load testing using shinytest2** etc. to check performance when we get multiple users (and see #231)
  - do profiling if needed to find bottlenecks in shiny app (especially initial loading/ issue #231). profvis etc.
  - do profiling to find bottlenecks in functions (first or only where app or key functions seem a bit slow). microbenchmark etc.
- caching
  - **caching plots** via shiny::renderCachedPlot() since plots are often a slow step.
  - **caching results in shiny** with shiny::bindCache() or caching function results via memoise package... see [useful discussion about bindCache](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/latest/bindcache) including section about session-specific caches vs  a cache that is shared across multiple R processes!
- make each user's browser do more of the work: ([explained here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhhBG8GzMmE))
  - e.g., DuckDB WASM (DuckDB is like SQLite but more for analytics work, and wasm is like assembly code in browser where you compile R to wasm and it runs in browser not on server; DuckDB + WebAssembly = extremely fast queries of a database despite many users.
  - e.g., Use javascript/browser to do more work so R/server can do less work. e.g., observable plot API is like ggplot2 (similar in spirit, style) but for JS. It is flexible and expressive like ggplot2. has tool tips now too. 
- maybe consider future and promises packages for asynch processing (see #99 )
 
**NON-SHINY / GENERAL**

- General tips on datasets, algorithms, etc.
  - Consider how datasets are designed and used in the code, to avoid some joins or use memory more efficiently or avoid loading nonessential columns, etc.
  - Fix where doing the same thing twice - some code seemed duplicative in doaggregate(). 
  - Get rid of for loops - Use vectorized functions (and not the apply family of functions). getblocksnearby() still has non-vectorized portions, and so does doaggregate() ! (But confirm this actually speeds it up)
  - Find algorithm improvements/ change in approach (as opposed to how the code implements that algorithm)
  - See tips on unit testing: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/04/unit-testing-analytics-code/
- **Cache and/or Precalculate**
  - **Preload** all large datasets early while user is not waiting (maybe using `callr` [callr](https://callr.r-lib.org/) to do it in a separate process). Decide if it is better to load large datasets at package attach time, via .onAttach() instead of when user does a query that triggers slow lazyloading? Wait will be either when pkg loads or when query is first done, right? These are the big ones: quaddata (168 MB), blockgroupstats  (54 MB), blockpoints (86 MB) and blockwts (31 MB), blockid2fips (20 MB) files
  - Cache prior requests in earlier sessions (e.g., default radius analysis of sample data like testpoints_10)
  - Cache prior requests in current session. memo-izing?  shiny::bindCache()  etc.
  - **Precalculate constants** or intermediate values if that saves time.
  - Consider **precalculating results** / being able to quickly offer final results for anticipated common queries! maybe 1 standard distance for most likely FRS sites?
  - Consider **precalculating sites2blocks tables** at some large distance for many FRS sites, and have `getblocksnearby()` be able to use that info when appropriate, filtering by the new specified distance, instead of doing the full recalculation of sites2blocks for a new specified distance.
  - Consider **precalculating slow step(s) within doaggregate().** It creates a new index vec and does some math that might be things that could be stored as data on FRS sites, eg.?
- **Use `data.table` package optimally**
  - Avoid code that makes copies of data.tables (e.g., x <- df[asdf]) and instead use setorder, setcolumns, setnames, and `:=`() to change everything by reference (same topic is discussed in collapse package now too)
  - Use data.table properly to do faster select/filter/join via the best approach (using keys properly, etc). 
-   **Use `collapse` package optimally** (along with data.table:: and maybe other fastverse pkgs, but not dplyr/tibble/data.frame), espec. for these operations:
    - See benchmarks comparing collapse, data.table, other packages: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05038 
    - See article about collapse package: https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/
    - Use the optimized versions of functions like fmean, fmin, fmax, funique (and maybe even could use fdist?)
    - Grouping/by=   see if faster to do grouping via collapse:: versus via data.table:: 
    - `cbind(data, someFUN(data[,cols])`   replace it with   `add_vars(data) <- someFUN(get_vars(data, cols))`
    - `cbind(data1, data2, data3, ...)` is slow, 
    - collapse::add_vars(data1, data2, data3, ...) much faster and preserves attributes of data1. 
    - collapse::add_vars(data) <- someFUN(get_vars(data, cols, pos= ))  efficiently appends data with *computed* columns.
    - `data[cols] <- someFUN(data[cols])`  replace with 10x more efficient `collapse::get_vars(data, cols) <- someFUN(get_vars(data, cols)) `
    - `x <- DT[ ]`       replace it with  something from collapse:: ?
    - `get_vars(<-)` is around 2x faster than `[.data.frame` and 8x faster than `[<-.data.frame` 
    - From collapse documentation:    https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/reference/select_replace_vars.html   
    - `data[sapply(data, is.numeric)] `or `data[sapply(data, is.numeric)] <- value` ... replace with `num_vars(data)` and `num_vars(data) <- value `
    - dplyr::select() is slow and `collapse::fselect` is about 100x faster 
    - weighted.mean() etc., replace with `collapse::fmean(x, w= )` and see fmin, fmax, funique, etc. - mostly done. 
    -    See https://sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2021/08/13/fastverse/

- **Parallel** processing. But consider if it requires each process has a full copy of the large block datasets.

- **Asynchronous** coding
  - Async coding is pretty hard to do well but probably essential for a couple of steps. async methods probably needed when concurrent users. There are multiple ways to add async programming to your Shiny app:
    1. callr to  Call R from R.  callR can speed it up for a single user at least. Simplest is to use **`callr `pkg**, e.g. to knit rmarkdown in background, to create localtree and do data(blockpoints), or maybe run getblocksnearby() and doaggregate() in background, etc. 
    2.  futures and promises, hard to use! but helps prevent other users from being slowed down by one user’s computations.  Unified Parallel and Distributed Processing in R and a promise library for R ?
    3. coro - Coroutines for R.

### notes on How to get Distribution of Indicator Scores and Average, in each Demog group 

Want each Demog's DISTRIBUTION OF DISTANCES or ENVT for
   - Envt indicators, and for
   - Dist/proximity/sitecount stats.
  
Also, want 
    - %D as function of distance
    - Distance (mean) as function of Demog group
  
   We have each blockgroup near each site, which means some small % of those bgs are duplicated in this intermediate (not returned) table:
     `sites2bgs_plusblockgroupdata_bysite`
    and for those stats we would want to take only unique blockgroups from here,
    using the shorter distance I think, so the distribution of distances does not doublecount people.
  
   Sometimes we want this info OVERALL (not by site)
    Sometimes we want to see that distribution of **distances by D** *for just 1 site*
     And also want to see the **%D as a function of continuous distance** *at just 1 site*
    So although it would be simpler, clearer to return just all unique blockgroups NOT by site,
     just to retain flexibility this function currently reports all instances of blockgroup-site pairing.
  But, 
   ### we could return BOTH tables that provide 2 versions of info bybg: 
     - **bybg_bysite** (every blockgroup by site) plus 
     - **bybg_overall** (all blockgroups overall)
   Also note we could return both as blocks (for a higher resolution stepwise almost continous distance distribution):
     - **byblock_bysite** (like sites2blocks from getblocksnearby, but maybe with bg indicators joined? not efficient but convenient?) 
     - **byblock_overall** (like sites2blocks from getblocksnearby, but maybe with bg indicators joined? not efficient but convenient?)

 Functionality to upload geodatabases are available, but we will need to consider all of the permutations of how these can be presented in a zip file. Currently, gdb.zip functionality is available in shapefile_xyz, but additional investigations are needed to identify how to process/identify layers for zips of geodatabase folders and of geodatabases.

Zip uploads are currently active on development. The gdb portion requires a bit more hooking up and testing to ensure that the application can correctly process geodatabase inputs of varying type quality. For example, many times geodatabases contain multiple layers. A robust upload method for complex gdb's like this may require some front end additions that allow users to choose the layer they want to see displayed. Additional checks for whether the layers are valid shapefile uploads would also need to be considered. Some of this functionality may be already applied in the shapefile_xyz.R script.

The number of elements in the variable rowfun is generated such that there are two times the number of elements in the input threshgroups. This is a problem because the variable bywhat only has 7 elements hard coded in it in the function batch.summarize, so in the forloop starting around line 400 that loops through the number of elements in rowfun, if there are more than 7 elements in rowfun, it will access something that is out of index in bywhat.  This is why the first input works because there are only 3 elements in threshgroups so it will not access anything past the 6th index, while the second input fails because it tries to access the 8th index in bywhat, which doesn't exist.

I am not sure what the possible fix is. I can include checks that stop the function running if it tries to access something out of bounds on bywhat, but that doesn't really address the problem of an input of more than 3 elements in threshnames not working. I am not sure about the purpose of this function and all the variables, but either the for loop needs to be addressed at line 400, or there needs to be more elements added to bywhat.

2. proximity score handling of which blocks are near which NPL/RMP/etc. sites
  - Distance **proximity** is measured from RMP (or other site) point or NPL polygon boundary to block group boundary (not bg centroid). 
  - then all blocks within those flagged block groups get included in the universe for calculation. 
  - proximity score Block-based calculations are still measured at centroid when summing 1/d even if the d is slightly larger than 10km. [this affects how the new proximity scores are created, like in proxistat() but not how doaggregate() would work]

4. Changes to the **proximity** calculations for proximity to X where X are polygons (to accommodate the NPL polygons or others):
  - if block point is inside the NPL polygon then that block's 1/d value is fixed at 1/d = 11.

Notes on questions, cleanup to do, etc. - notes as of 12/24**

**How to Install** 
- Confirmed one can use 
`x = build(vignettes=FALSE, manual=FALSE, clean_doc=T, binary=F)`
- Confirmed one can use
`install.packages(""https://github.com/USEPA/ejscreen-multisite-open/archive/refs/tags/v2.32-public.tar.gz"")` for public branch installation
- see https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM-open/archive/refs/tags/v2.32.tar.gz for full / main branch open source version of full pkg/main branch 12/2025
- Must update the installation instructions in the pkgdown ghpages website/article, etc.
   

**The short idea now is this:**  We can keep the “EJAM” repo private and place onto some public repo(s) a  .tar.gz file(s) letting anyone install the “EJAM” package (built from the MAIN branch and/or from the PUBLIC-EJSCREEN branch). This lets us deploy to the public server from a public repo, right? And this lets us keep “EJAM” as the internal repo (so our branches, issues, etc. are preserved and links in them work), while still sharing with public an installable package named “EJAM” and giving them access to the public pkgdown pages that talk about the package being named “EJAM.” 

In other words, ASAP

1) we create a minimal public repo that has just an installable source bundle of an “EJAM” package that is a copy of the essential branch/parts of the EJAM package, as .tar.gz   via build() made from a cleaned-up copy of the PUBLIC-EJSCREEN branch, a new public repo called whatever, like “ejscreen-multisite-open” Then DMAP could deploy to public server from that???  Would that work as a way to instantly fix the challenges of migrating to public facing production server?

2) we finally share the package just enough to make it easy to install for a public user, to install the MAIN branch version, -- we do essentially the same thing as above, but build an installable source tar.gz from today’s MAIN branch, and host that on a new public repo, maybe called “EJAM-open”  The package bundled and saved there would still be called “EJAM”   It would be just the built source package so it would have no other branches, no issues, no extra folders and notes and no datacreate etc. for now. Just a way someone can use the R package (and run the app locally if they want to). That at least would let anyone use the package in R.

Later,
 To provide a true open source development repo we can work that out soon/later, but need to figure out the naming issue, and which if any branches and issues to include there. 

_The key thing that would not work is the public trying to click links that point to the still-private “EJAM” repo.  The problem with links and repo names is that I think if we want to keep branches and issues private/internal, but have the pkgdown and R-based documentation public, we cannot have it both ways – either all the Issues and commit history info/branch can work and still point to a repo called “EJAM”  or else  all the manuals/.Rd/pkgdown help docs can work and still point to a repo called “EJAM” – but I don’t see how to share public documentation but keep private the history of branches and issues. But I think if the package name is EJAM then even if the bundle is hosted somewhere else they can install and use the EJAM package and the only links that will fail will be the ones that refer to the internal github repository called EJAM. Links for documentation and pkgdown site would work._

more / older notes:

**GOALS/STAGES/ OVERALL APPROACH** - make sure we understand purpose of sharing bundle just so they can install the app and run LOCAL web app or use in console, versus something appropriate for them to host themselves for the public (epa logos e.g. would be a problem), versus sharing full source code essential to build from source (why), versus full source code so they can do some development/ modify/ do pull requests, such as providing vignettes, tests, functions that are draft/not yet used, etc.; and for them to have access to everything else.

**BINARY , SOURCE , KEY BRANCHES , FOLDERS , or FULL REPO?**  Before we are ready to make an entire repo public even with just one branch of source code, even with no issues or git history, we should just host/share source bundle (or binary if we do that) of the cleaned up package. But is there even a way to offer an installable package that does not give them the full source code, in case they want to just use the package but do not need to have the source folders? Does a binary do that except it requires making a binary for win, macos, linux each separately? Will everything in the package even work in that case, just without ability to edit source? You can still see the source code without comments if you have only the installed pkg, but all the datacreate, etc. documentation would be left out. Do we want to first offer a version people can use but not show them the complete set of folders yet? 

**REPOSITORIES - WHICH SHOULD HOST WHAT?**
Ideas for repositories to create and which to be public vs internal, have just source bundle vs just source vs full set of branches and issues:
- **`ejscreen-multisite-open`**  public repo - did a release, just to share .tar.gz source bundle that is built from cleaned up source snapshot PUBLIC-EJSCREEN branch. no code, branches, issues, etc. Just that tar.gz file. No .arrow files in data folder before built.
- **`EJAM`**  or else **`EJAM-open`**  1) for source snapshot bundle built from cleaned up MAIN branch, AND 2) open source for developers- clarify what to include... start with no issues, only main and development branches, but possibly also PUBLIC-EJSCREEN? But if this public repo is not named EJAM, the pkgdown site at a minimum would need to be redone and before that all the help docs as roxygen .Rd files would have to get redone so links work, and all the references to the package name, etc.
- **`EJAM`**  or else **`EJAM-dev`**  full internal development repo with all branches and issues and pkgdown site etc. etc. Not built, not public. But if this internal repo is not still named EJAM, all the links to issues or files or commits or etc. would be messed up as they try to point back to the original EJAM repo etc. 

**BRANCHES** - when we share a public repo, we want to start with only one or very few branches, but which ones? maybe just one, maybe also a dev branch?
Do not make the bundle from the main branch or development branch, for now - for now, create a new branch that is “opensource” and use that version to clean up folders, files, etc. that will be included in the shared public source bundle

**ISSUES** - when we share a public repo, we want to start with zero issues, or possibly some important ones where we actually want to solicit open source dev contributions? easiest is start with zero issues.

**EPA LOGO** - how to handle the EPA logos? code about them? in header of website but also in community report, etc. We might need a switch/file similar to public vs internal version controls, that controls if it is a branch/release that is suitable for the public to run themselves — particularly in regards to the EPA logos since we maybe do not want them to publish a hosted app that still has our epa logos in it? but if they run it locally the epa logo makes sense! and simply dropping the logos does not make sense since we want attribution/credit - maybe just need to ensure the license and instructions make clear how/if they can use the EPA logo?

**isPublic:**  I do not think we want default options to be isPublic=FALSE for the open source / shared package?we want EPA staff and developers to be able to easily use the full app. but if they want to host the app we need to make sure we emphasize caution on that.

**DELETE / clean up** these or some of them, before sharing bundle snapshot of package public open source, HOWEVER some of the things below will automatically get excluded from a build/ bundle so the only reason to delete them would be if the entire repository is open that has all these source folders, not if just the built bundle itself is the only thing shared.

5) combine it with some code that would save a copy of each on pins board and/or AWS or public repo (see some code in EJAM/data-raw/datacreate_0_UPDATE_ALL_DATASETS.R for example)
6) also add some code that writes updated metadata as needed in pins board and AWS (see EJAM/data-raw/datacreate_0_UPDATE_ALL_DATASETS.R etc.)
7) decide how often to update each (weekly?) - check how often ECHO and FRS and EJScreen update FRS info, and how. There is some EPA updating service via geoplatform too? And FRS is also available via API as a new/different approach.
8) decide and then implement mechanism to use for the recurring job(s). Mechanisms could be:

EJAM's estimated distances for 100 points were often half a meter but up to 4 (or even 6 in one case) meters smaller than EJScreen/ESRI distance estimates (at radius of 1 mile or 1609 meters) and sometimes up to 1 meter larger than the ESRI estimate. EJAM was  compared to esri’s geodesic distance method. That’s causing the slight difference in results.

AH's suggestion:
  EJScreen is measuring geodesic and [it seems that EJAM is] measuring them planar, so
**... try using this package to see if you can replicate EJScreen’s distances:**
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geodist/geodist.pdf

This is the engine esri uses to calculate geodesic length:
https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-geometryEngine.html#geodesicLength

And if you’re buffering anything, this is the geodesic buffer engine:
https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-geometryEngine.html#geodesicBuffer

more details, probably not needed:
Details on code for EJScreen finding nearby block points:

EJScreen uses the function called ""`esriSpatialRelEnum.esriSpatialRelIntersects`""
to do what EJAM does in `EJAM::getblocksnearby()` or `EJAM::get_blockpoints_in_shape()`
The ESRI function is very briefly mentioned in these pages:
https://developers.arcgis.com/enterprise-sdk/api-reference/net/esriSpatialRelEnum/
https://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/java_ao_adf/api/arcobjects/com/esri/arcgis/geodatabase/esriSpatialRelEnum.html

Code samples to demonstrate how EJScreen finds nearby block points using VB.NET
and the intersection function from ESRI to intersect the circular buffer or the polygon of whatever shape) with the set of all Census block internal points, 
with the function called
`esriSpatialRelEnum.esriSpatialRelIntersects`

The EJScreen code samples are in a file saved as ""0_EJSCREEN_ej_buffer_steps.pdf""
in an older commit in a dev folder, and later removed. It explains how EJScreen does the following: 

Use the analysis polygon to perform a spatial query on block centroid points. This returns all block centroids in the study area. Each centroid point has the Blockgroup ID it is part of and the population percentage it contains.

[Note the difference between simpler Euclidean distance or buffering and complex but accurate Geodesic buffering. As explained here https://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0111/geodesic.html  for small distances both approaches are almost identical. For distances of 500 miles, e.g., the difference between methods is huge.]

","see #113 for the full outline of all steps in replicating.

**Goal:** 

Modify `EJAM::getblocksnearby() `and related functions...to fix any discrepancy in which blocks are identified as within X miles.

**Problem:**

There often is a 1 OR 2 BLOCKS DIFFERENCE IN WHAT EJAM and EJScreen identify as WITHIN 3 MILES OF A POINT. Out of a few dozen or hundreds of blocks within 3 miles, EJAM often agrees on all but 1 or 2. Testing a small set points for a 3.1 mile radius in EJScreen vs EJAM shows a difference of plus or minus 1 block very often, and sometimes 4 or 5 blocks. In every case checked, the discrepancy in pop count was entirely explained by the discrepancy in blocks considered inside vs outside the circle. That in some cases is a 2% error in population count vs EJScreen's, but on average might be an absolute error of 0.2% in population count within 3.1 miles.

**Solutions:**

Try each and run comparison code after each, to see if that was the issue:

0) As of 8/2024, getblocksnearby() removed default distance adjustment for small distances, which might now better reflect what EJScreen does! see explanation in other issues and changes to getblocksnearby() circa 8/8/24.

1) !!! **The problem is (mostly) in the exact distance calculation step** !!! try replacing `pdist()` by trying a different method -- **see the comments added below about the geodist package!!** (probably slower but more accurate, as might be sf::st_something) to find exact distance to each nearby block -- only after getblocksnearby() has narrowed it down (quickly identified those nearby).

2) We already made sure that the main problem is not **coordinates/ projections issues**: see SAIC code (on github now) for EJScreen details on local coordinates projections that EJScreen uses before doing proximity analysis like getblocksnearby does. Initial conversations suggested these differences in map projections could explain some EJAM-EJScreen differences in population count inside each circular buffer. But, this is done now - see comment on this issue. Did not see any obvious difference related to coordinate system/projection! May still need to fix EJAM assumptions about CRS being either NAD83 or WGS84, in the shapefile functions, but not sure that has much impact on distances between lat/lon-specified facilities and blocks. 

3) Make sure a minor problem is not in the **`rectLookup()` step**. In getblocksnearby functions, **try expanding the rectangle created by SearchTrees::rectLookup() to be something like 1% or 3% larger, just in case it was missing some block points that EJScreen actually considers to be inside the radius. Does that fix it?**

4) **Rounding or accuracy / precision** is NOT the issue.",https://api.github.com/repos/USEPA/EJAM/issues/283/comments,3/19/2024,9/11/2024,ejanalysis,ejanalysis,1,0,0,FALSE

> - 350 had demographic data (N returned no results due to estimated zero nearby residents, i.e., no nearby Census block points)


some other details:

In the summary report header etc., it now says for points, ""_...any of the 386 selected points_"" for example. But it is not clear what 386 represents and what ""selected points"" means. One source of confusion is that the upload page says how many are invalid in the sense of bad or missing lat lon, while the summary report says how many are valid in the sense of those issues AND the issue of zero population or block points nearby -- so the numbers seem to disagree. Try this example:
```
pts <- structure(list(`original row` = c(1, 2, 3), lat = c(""39.746490000000001"", 
"" 37.838648"", ""36.068006526329597""), lon = c(-74.20121, -109.655858, 
-5.17031658322482), notes = c(""valid with signif pop within 1 mile"", 
""valid but zero pop within 1 mile"", ""nonUSA latlon"")), row.names = c(NA, 
-3L), class = ""data.frame"")
out <- ejamit(pts, radius = 1)
# or try it in the shiny app
```

Also, confirm that the difference in those numbers is solely due to missing lat lon or invalid lat lon as opposed to good latlon but no results due to very small radius relative to local block size, for example, or zero population in nearby block, or other factors.

This issue is about adding ability to navigate to a folder and specify that whole folder (without needing to navigate into it), and have app look in folder to get the .shp etc. files needed. 

This may be a bit tricky since right now the upload is written to expect one or more files not a folder, and not sure how to make it flexible enough so a user can do either one as needed.

What worked for a simple example but is an awkward workflow:
- Deploy from branch, deploy from Master branch, use docs folder, are the 3 settings to specify in [github settings page for Pages]( https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM/settings/pages 
)
- MAYBE but not sure do usethis::use_pkgdown() but not usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages() since the defaults were not what was needed!
- MAYBE do  pkgdown::build_site_github_pages() once at least to set it up.
- put a .nojekyll file in the docs folder ! jekyll issue made it fail to build on github
- remove docs folder from the items in .gitignore file ! that had been put there by one of above functions, and if publishing from docs after building locally via build_site(), you have to push that folder to github for it to get published. (unless using a gh action to do the whole thing, build site on github as notes down below suggest, in which case you do not need to always upload local docs folder)
- manually do pkgdown::build_site() to do each update, after which must commit and push the docs folder changes
- see https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM/actions to watch the site get republished after built locally and pushed 
(see a working simplistic site here:
browseURL(""https://github.com/ejanalysis/ejscreendata/actions"")
browseURL(""https://github.com/ejanalysis/ejscreendata/settings/pages"")

- If interested in created an **automated workflow** e.g. see EPA example here: https://github.com/USEPA/TADA/blob/develop/.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml to update the site automatically whenever you make changes (e.g. when you merge in a pull request)? 
- Or do you want to **run code to update the site** outside of an automated workflow; i.e., run: `pkgdown::build_site()` see: https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/ ? 

Another EPA team had to get the auto-build site workflow approved by our EPA org GitHub admins first (they maintain a list of all approved automated github workflows), but it is approved now so anyone can use it. It should be fairly easy to update the .yaml example for your package.

More notes from https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github_pages.html
`use_github_pages(branch = ""gh-pages"", path = ""/"", cname = NA)`

2 common options for branch and path for the site source:
This function anticipates two specific usage modes:

1. NOT USED BY EJAM: Publish from the **_root_** directory of a gh-pages branch, which is assumed to be only (or at least primarily) a remote branch. Typically the gh-pages branch is managed by an automatic ""build and deploy"" job, such as the one configured by [use_github_action(""pkgdown"")](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github_action.html).
- The **default of branch = ""gh-pages"" and path = ""/""** reflects **strong GitHub support for this configuration:** when a gh-pages branch is first created, it is automatically published to Pages, using the source found in ""/"". If a gh-pages branch does not yet exist on the host, use_github_pages() creates an empty, orphan remote branch.

2. USED BY EJAM: Publish from the ""/docs"" directory of a ""regular"" branch, probably the repo's default branch. The user is assumed to have a plan for how they will manage the content below ""/docs"".
- The most common **alternative is to use the repo's default branch, coupled with path = ""/docs"".** It is the user's responsibility to ensure that this branch pre-exists on the host.

Group - avg person vs bg vs ""other 3-mile circles"" - in rural, county, user-defined etc.

At least 2-3 issues to work on, discuss: 
1. Comparing the avg person vs avg facility (or site) vs avg block group - There is not apples to apples consistent comparison in columns or ratios or percentiles, currently. The state averages in EJScreen for example and the percentiles all are for avg block group or bg percentile, not avg person. Ideally they would be apples to apples, like pop wtd percentiles and averages compared to pop avg near sites, etc. We probably want to allow comparison of ""sites"" not just entirely focus on ""average resident"" but those give very different answers and need to be communicated carefully. 
2. Isn't it technically incorrect to compare scores for avg person within X miles of a site to avg person elsewhere like avg person in state or us? For an apples to apples comparison, you need to compare scores in 3mile circles here versus scores in 3mile circles elsewhere, since avg in a large circle is always less variable than for avg of all residents or avg block, e.g. A score is not drastically different for avg bg in US vs avg person in US, but for larger radius or large FIPS or polygon it can matter a lot! A 10-mile circle or a whole county will never have a very extreme score, while a single block group sometimes will.
3. allow a few **other predefined geo zones** to be the reference zone, not just state and USA, like 
  - county, 
  - rural areas, and

as in the examples shown at https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/articles/4_advanced.html#how-to-analyze-proximity-using-ejam  

How we might show results:
- see examples in the article/vignette ... show about 3 radii side by side in a new type of table and plot of just 1 or a few key indicator results.
- interactively explore sensitivity to radius?
- the code figures out sensitivity and summarizes what distance shows max disparity, e.g., and flags whether results are highly sensitive to distance, etc.

How people might specify and use it:  (not final decisions but ideas) and how to efficiently implement each:
- **Preselected Distances and points**:  app could offer only/mostly some preselected cached distances and results for FRS sites like ECHO does - faster and easier for user and discourages overly short radii. Use preselected cached distances and results for FRS sites (like ECHO does). custom radius or custom point would be separate feature. no code exists yet for this idea but ultimately would provide a better user experience since so fast.
- **2 or 3 key distances**:  The easy-to-implement, simple way is we only analyze 2-3 radii, and analyze each discrete distance on the fly separately as via  `ejamit_compare_distances()`  - This is already coded but not in web UI, but kind of inefficient since it repeats work as it analyzes each radius separately. functions already exist. see https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/articles/4_advanced.html#within-multiple-distances---comparing-radius-choices  a) User could specify 1 max radius, and then tool would check subsets of that (discrete like 2,3,4 miles or else ""continuous"" distance via bybg) b) User could specify 2-5 discrete radii at once.
- **Explore various discrete distances on the fly?:** another related option is they specify one max radius and we run that and save the huge sites2blocks output of getblocksnearby() so we/they can then compare results for smaller radii after the fact, by on-the-fly using doaggregate's radius parameter to aggregate just subsets of all blocks found earlier. would want to check how much faster that really is. That approach allows us to show block-level resolution of what happens as function of continuous distance. at the BLOCK resolution by retaining the info in sites2blocks from getblocksnearby() ...  to retain all the output of getblocksnearby() which is huge but then could filter it to run doaggregate on various subsets - but that only saves the time of running getblocks and still means running doagg for each distance...
- **Block Groups for stepwise distance**: another option is they specify one max radius and run doaggregate on the full distance, saving the bybg table that stores info on each blockgroup -- then on the fly they can see results for a subset radius and/or  as a somewhat-continuous distribution of all radii - maybe interactively adjusting radius, or just in plots showing how X changes depending on the radius (like we already can do via the results_bybg_people at the blockGROUP resolution).
- **BLOCKS for Continuous Distance:** another option is higher-resolution more ""continuous"" block resolution, on the fly - this is like what is done by plot_distance_by_pctd() already. see https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/articles/4_advanced.html#how-demographics-at-one-site-vary-as-a-continuous-function-of-distance 
","There are at least 3 separate questions here: 
**1. When to calculate or retain big tables of distance info:** when/ whether to precalculate or cache or just retain for some process steps, like while an analyst is working with one set of places.
2. **Resolution: blocks vs bg vs bins**: do we save all the details like sites2blocks table versus just blockgroup rollup of distance of avg person per bg. Possibly even retaining binned distances only, like info about those 0-1 miles away, 1-2 miles away, etc.
3. **How to summarize** the info, what to show in plots of various kinds and in tables. Showing continuous distribution of distance? Showing bins of distance? Cumulative versus at each distance (annular/ ring view)? Showing distance by group versus %D or E by distance, or both?

A very long list of global variables/objects and also ""parameters"" are loaded or set, and in a many different ways 
1. Many variables are set up by the global.R files from 2 pkgs (EJAM and EJAMejscreenapi), via a workaround sourcing them from run_app()
2. Others are set up by dataload_from_pins(). 
3. Others are lazy loaded because they are files in EJAM/data/ 
4. Some code checks if an object exists and might be checking specifically only in the global environment.
5. options() might be used (as is done in app.R)
6. golem's config file might get used? see  app_sys(""golem-config.yml"") 
7. Environment variables might be used? by local Rprofile or Renviron files? by Posit Connect server?
8. some settings are handled via parameters in .Rmd yaml headers
9. some settings are handled via the advanced tab
10. some settings are handled via each function's default values for its parameters 
11. Some ""settings"" are the metadata in the xlsx that creates map_headernames, such as the desired sort order of indicators on a report, how many decimal places to use, etc.

This seems complicated and messy and has some disadvantages:
- In general, people suggest global variables should be avoided where possible.
- A package with a lot of MB of data in /data/*.rda  is too large to quickly rebuild, share, submit to CRAN, etc.
- They are hard to keep track of because they are created in at least 3 different ways, making code error prone (and debugging is more complicated)
- updates and changes to settings or behavior is harder (not as clear where you would look to make a given change)
- documentation is harder/ complicated
- It creates challenges if an analyst wants to use the package without the app, since they might require some variables that are only created when the app sources global.R 
- it could create a lot of objects that can clutter the RStudio analyst's envt, espec if they run the app locally and then stop to do some work in RStudio console. 

Ideas:
1. One option is just leave this all as-is, because changing any of this takes effort and would need to be worth it.
2. These issues are spread out across the EJAM package, and ejscreenapi modules in EJAM pkg, and code in EJAMejsceenapi. Most could be consolidated into one package. That seems relatively easy. map_headernames in particular seems out of place being outside EJAM package.
3. Larger datasets, actual tables etc., should all be in one place, probably, such as pin board not /data/ etc.?
4. These could be consolidated into fewer approaches, like phasing out use of global.R. Or maybe phasing out use of files in /R/data/ ?
5. Should we use a special environment to put global variables into, rather than global env?  See  `cat(""\n\n"", paste0(example(topic = ""sys.source"", give.lines = TRUE), collapse = ""\n""))`  Good overview of environments is here: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/environments.html 
6. maybe the .Rmd yaml parameters should depend entirely on some other unified source of parameters/settings, so we never need to update anything within the .Rmd docs.
7. not sure if there are pros/cons of using golem-config.yml, or options() or environment variables.

FIPS works at the lowest level functions in EJAMejscreenapi like these:
`ejscreenRESTbroker()` already has parameters that allow a query of 1 blockgroup instead of 1 latlon point, such as
`ejscreenRESTbroker(fips = ""360810383010"")`  for a blockgroup, compiled like this:

Perhaps the parameters could be similar to how ejamit() already handles this via `EJAM::ejamit(fips = )

Decide how to reconcile this.,bug|good first issue|urgency low|calculate/validate to EJScreen,4538805065|4538805069|6227891676|6343712128,d73a4a|7057ff|cfd3d7|FBCA04,"Something isn't working|Good for newcomers||related to errors in numbers, replicating EJScreen stats",1,"**The Issue**

- In EJAM we display the **State Avg and US Avg** values (as reference columns and as ratio denominators and maybe on plots) as taken from usastats or statestats, which actually provides averages that are for the avg _Blockgroup_ not avg person. 
- In EJAM when we calculate and display the **Average Overall or for 1 site analyzed**, we have been showing numbers on the _average resident_, via pop wtd avg of each indicator. 
- In **EJScreen if you run a report** on site near a point, it does use the wtd mean like EJAM does... the population (or other denominator like residents age 25+ or households) weighted average of each indicator, NOT the average Blockgroup.
- In EJScreen if you run a report on a County, check what it reports.

For a circular buffer, this distinction is not obvious on a report, but even so the comparison of avg person near site versus avg block group in the State is not really a ""fair"" comparison. At least it is misleading. Especially if you use Ratio of avg person here to avg block group in US, or avg bg in State.  

The problem is also very obvious and confusing _if you run an analysis comparing all the counties in 1 State_, such as 
x <- ejamit(fips = fips_counties_from_statename(""Alabama"")) or in shiny using the Alabama counties test data. In that case, you see two columns side by side that both should be the Alabama average, but they are noticeably different numbers.

The problem is broader actually, since it applies to _percentiles_ also - all percentiles shown are as percent of blockgroups not people. That probably will NOT be changed in EJAM, since it is not a huge difference except in tails, I believe and is hard to explain. Worth discussing with EPA analysts. 

**What to do?**
- At a minimum we need a footnote explaining why averages differ at least when someone analyzes all places that comprise a state, like all counties compared. 
- We might want that explanation all the time
- Alternative is to show State Avg column that is Avg Resident in State, which is better but not what EJScreen report shows. Communication problem. I'm leaning towards showing true average resident not the EJScreen approach. 
- For RATIOS to State or US Average, we should use avg person not blockgroup. But that argues further for not even showing the avg blockgroup numbers.



**Details**
- confirmed that average column on report is drawn from and identical to 
 ` t(statestats[statestats$REGION == ""AL"" & statestats$PCTILE == ""mean"",  ""traffic.score""])`

Redo the names in lists like names_d etc., in EJAM\data-raw\datacreate_names_of_indicators.R for consistency, logical naming structure/ predictability, clarity, brevity, etc.

### Goals
1) ensure 100% consistency between map_headernames$names_friendly, $varlist, $longname_tableheader, 
versus the names_xyz lists, and the namez$ approach if will keep using it; and 
2) make names more predictable/ based on a logical approach to name construction, to make it easier to find/replace/update names and make it easier to construct a name from its components for QA/QC and flexibility and ease of updates; 
3) use plain English and ensure clarity, no ambiguity (e.g., is it a count or fraction, is it US or State or other, is the denominator explicit or at least reasonably obvious, etc. However, we cannot provide a truly complete explanation of each indicator and people need to refer to documentation sometimes for details like data source, vintage, maybe the exact denominator (universe), maybe even for units? Not sure we always need to show units like for proximity scores that have long descriptions of units.
4) keep them from getting extremely long where feasible without loss of clarity.
5) retain in map_headernames the columns preserving the indicator names text copied from and exactly as labelled in: EJScreen reports, glossary, metadata in API, etc.
6) (sorting them is easier and useful? But whether US or State is the first word rather than Average or Percentile or Count, you still have metadata in map_headernames that lets you filter and sort easily.)

The datacreate file's naming of ""friendly"" labels seemed like a good starting point, since it was more consistent and careful in many cases than what was in map_headernames names_friendly column and longname_tableheader column.
The commented lines in datacreate_names_of_indicators.R that say   #  dput(
were just put there as a way to switch to using map_headernames as the source for EJAM variable name lists which would keep them consistent....  dput in datacreate names of indicators was to change all to the maphead$ longnames versions of friendly names, 

### Need to make the changes in this sequence
- In names_xyz, namez$xyz, and map_headernames (long and friendly columns), make capitalization consistent (thus simplifying global find/replace, etc.), by 1st making it all lowercase (then doing search/replace fixes below, then semi-manually fixing capitalization as the last step - lots of changes would be needed, done manually probably)
- (*****_somewhere_**?) do replacements globally (where??? ***) to fix certain words / **replacements listed below**.
- use a table of variables as created via the bit of script in EJAM/data-raw/datacreate_names_of_indicators.R datacreate_names of indicators, the table called ""out"", as a way to look at, compare, and select which to use as long/friendly and check things
- (*****_manually_**??) copy the best version of each name into the spreadsheet map_headernames (the long and friendly columns)
- run script  EJAMejscreenapi/data-raw/datacreate_map_headernames.R
- reinstall EJAMejscreenapi package
- run script  EJAMejscreenapi/data-raw/datacreate_testoutput_ejscreenit_or_ejscreenapi_plus_50.R
- reinstall EJAMejscreenapi again 
- test EJAMejscreenapi package
- run EJAM/data-raw/datacreate_testpoints_testoutputs.R ... and other related datacreate_ files   
- reinstall EJAM package
- test EJAM package 

### Global search/ replace changes to make (in both/all sources of long/friendly names)
 - make all lowercase to facilitate search/ replace and fix caps at the end of all this
 - replace percent (but not -ile not -age) with %  
 - replace percentage with % 
 - replace avg with average etc.
 - replace hhlds or hhld with households or household
 - replace ""Count of"" with ""Number of"" as plain english term and more consistent.
 - consider if/when can replace ""average for"" with ""average"" (confirm it always makes sense to do so, percentile for)
 keep ""percentile"" with ""percentile"" 
 - replace ""National"" with ""US""
 - ""Percent of population speaking"" should be ""% speaking""
 - things like ""... Average of Persons with Disabilities"" should more clearly say ""... Average of % with Disabilities"" (but keep count/number of persons with ..., and ... Average of Households without ...)
 - THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHERS THAT MAKE SENSE ... LOOK AT LISTS OF TERMS AFTER THOSE EDITS ARE DONE

- add list of columns to round using named vectors:
` x100varnames = c(names_d, names_d_avg, names_d_state_avg, names_d_subgroups, names_d_subgroups_avg, names_d_subgroups_state_avg, ""pctdisability"",  ""p_own_occupied"", ""pctunder18"", ""pctover17"", ""pctmale"", ""pctfemale""))`

- ""var_value"" is a bad choice for this parameter since it represents the R variable name (e.g., ""pm"") not the value (e.g., 7). Maybe use rname or varname. Then the friendly name could be called longname. This comment applies to a few functions in this file.

- Remove for loops in favor of vectorized code: Maybe this is not a bottleneck and profiling would reveal that, but wouldn't it be better to vectorize these functions in a more ""R-like"" fashion, so that you call it once to handle a list of indicators, and it would not use for loops at all?

- The hard-coded variables should be replaced with a generic approach, one that is easier to update each year as the lists of indicators change. One solution is there could be function parameters like
evarnames = names_e, evarlongnames = fixcolnames(evarnames, 'r', 'long'),
dvarnames = c(names_d, names_subgroups), dvarlongnames = fixcolnames(dvarnames, 'r', 'long'),
and then further down the code would say
var_values_e <- evarnames instead of listing them in the code

- ensure that all named vectors are used in proper places - multiple instances of missing indicators, such as `names_e` or `names_d_subgroups`

- replace text describing numbers of indicators with more generic text
    - ""There are thirteen EJ indexes and supplemental indexes in EJScreen reflecting the 13 environmental indicators.""
should be written to be more generic so we don't have to edit it each year they decide to revise the count of indicators:
""For each of the environmental indicators in EJScreen, there is an EJ Index and a Supplemental EJ Index.""
    - ""They combine data on percent low-income, percent linguistically isolated, percent less than high school education, percent unemployed, and low life expectancy with a single environmental indicator.""

We need to 
1) **test bounds** to learn at what points the various components start to fail (**THIS STEP IS SOMEWHAT URGENT & is essentially a bug - need to know what the boundaries are for _what should be allowed or warned about_, until we have time to handle pushing those bounds)**. The problems probably start to occur when you have a combination of large R and large N, and probably scales linearly with N but as the square of R since the number of block points grows with area which is proportional to R squared. 
2) **adjust the caps**: as interim fix, put in caps that do not allow a user to run Radius > RMAX and point count > NMAX. We already have done this but might want to adjust those caps based on step 1 (testing bounds a little more methodically).
3) **warn users** about the RSLOW and NSLOW where it slows down enough to be concerning but has not yet hit the caps RMAX and NMAX where it is so bad we don't allow them to do it at all. 
4) **Use advanced tab** - the advanced settings are a place where we could allow some users to increase the default caps. Code was drafted to allow that already but would need cleaning / testing/ fleshing out. 
4) **Code solutions for huge analyses** to handle those cases where radius is > current RMAX and/or points count is > current NMAX  --  this is an enhancement and is less urgent, but very useful to be able to run an analysis of radius of 6 miles or even 31 miles (50km), and also useful to be able to run 30,000 or 100k or 1.5 million facilities at once rather than needing to manually create batches.

**Solutions ideas/examples:**
(Doing things in batches is the obvious solution, but here are some other ideas as well)
- better memory management in general, possibly explicitly doing gc() before and after a large job
- rethinking how maps should display or not display large counts of points
- rethinking how certain calculation bottlenecks are done? doaggregate() seems especially bad at very large analysis, but not sure where that problem occurs.
- batching the sites for `getblocksnearby()`, analyzing NMAX sites at a time (possibly a reasonable NMAX depends on R)
- batching the sites for `doaggregate()`, analyzing NMAX sites at a time (possibly a reasonable NMAX depends on R)
- batching the sites in outputs (**objects, files, and web views**), meaning assembling the final results only in appropriately sized batches for each given component of the displays/ outputs -- NOT assembling final results if truly large datasets are best kept in separate objects, files, and displays. For example maybe run things in batches of 10,000 points as long as radius is <5 miles and then display/save results only in groups of 1,000 or less? for interactive tables and maps, and allow spreadsheet of up to 50,000 points at a time??? Those are just hypothetical examples of cutoffs.

**Components that are likely to need fixes for larger R and N values:**

- memory limitations mean the output of getblocksnearby() will be too big to hold all the distance pairs 
- doaggregate() function scales poorly with increasing size of analysis
- maps 
- interactive datatable of site by site results 
- excel spreadsheet will not work or will be very slow to create and save
- scatter plots? other plots?
- others? there are probably others worth listing here.

Someone just needs to methodically go through which of these metrics we want, confirm they are correctly calculated in the code, and spot check a set of results as reality checks.

doaggregate() tries to calculate various summary stats on distance from residents to sites, but not sure it provides all the useful ones, no useless ones, and is doing it exactly right. Confirm what it provides and how it calculates each is correct, useful, and correctly labelled or described accurately, since this is a bit tricky. It is tricky to keep track of and accurately name exactly what we are calculating and reporting in summary stats about DISTANCE (and similarly for summary stats about COUNTS of nearby sites). The summary stats happen at a few levels of resolution or aggregation like block, bg, etc.

Stats on Distances to sites or Counts of sites, as listed out below, can be

The edge cases are about how to handle a circular buffer report where only <10 block centroids or <5 or even zero block centroids are within X miles of a site... For example if the entire circle is inside or nearly entirely inside one or two block shapes, it is not obvious what is the best way to report which blocks are ""nearby"" and a second concern is reporting stats on the average person's distance from sites -- if someone tries to rely on that stat (not reported by EJScreen but useful for some kinds of analysis!) then it can be very wrong for the block(s) that have a site inside the block or even exactly on top of the block centroid where distance would be reported as zero if unadjusted.

Notes below are from before the default short distance adjustment got removed from getblocksnearby().


EJAM must correctly handle cases where the adjusted distance (via block_radius_miles) is > radius the user specified. 

This means some of the tests for doaggregate() etc. might need to be aware of how this should be handled, since it is a tricky odd situation - user might ask for analysis of radius 1 mile, but output of getblocksnearby() will include some distances larger than 1 mile, because some blocks might have effective radius >1mile, and this is somewhat unexpected. Worth thinking about how to alert / warn user and how to handle in logic where we might have assumed the max distance found is roughly what they wanted analyzed, and what distance to use in reporting stats like average resident's distance, minimum distance, in summary stats and in plots of distance by group or %Demog within each distance, etc.

 ","Some more notes related to this issue:
the short distance adjustment and the use of avoid orphans parameter and max radius parameter ... 
 
This approach may eliminate from analysis a site that is in a very large rural block if there are no other blocks nearby and the block very large /  is so large that  getblocksnearby() reported the only distances are to the one block and that gets reported as > requested radius of analysis because even though some residents may be < radius away from the site, the avg resident in the block is > radius requested. 
and filtering again by distance having to be <radius requested would remove those sites and blocks from any analysis. 
 This case is rare, but running 20 sets of 1,000 random facilities, **at typically about 3 sites per 1,000 sites** (ranging 0 to 6 sites per each 1,000 analyzed),   **no reported distances were within the 1 mile radius requested** for analysis, as reported by getblocksnearby()  and that is a problem.

*** STOP ADJUSTING SHORT DISTANCES -- in getblocksnearby(), ejamit(), shiny app, etc. 

- The short distance adjustment documented in EJScreen tech docs was used where the distance from sitepoint to blockpoint is smaller than the ""effective radius"" of a block (what its radius would be if that same square mileage of the block were shaped like a circle). The purpose was to make the distance reflect distance of site to average resident in block rather than to centroid of  block, so it would convert a distance of almost zero to some small but more realistic distance.
- Distances are used mostly for 2 things: 1) creating a proximity score each year for each blockgroup, such as the TSDF proximity indicator that considers which TSDF facilities are at various distances from a block centroid. 2) deciding which blocks are within X miles of a facility, for a circular buffer report to aggregate nearby residents (nearby blocks).
- We are not 100% certain EJScreen makes this distance adjustment for short distances when aggregating in a buffer. The adjustment was originally designed to handle proximity score creation, not aggregation within buffer reports. 
- EJAM was using distance adjustments in getblocksnearby() and related functions, which might not reflect EJScreen methodology.
- The v2.3 block weights file obtained from EJScreen team does not provide a column with area (square miles) so we cannot calculate effective block radius to store in the blockwts table as was needed to do the distance adjustment. V 2.2 EJAM had gotten area directly from Census 2020 using code in census2020download:: and EJAM/data-raw/datacreate_blockwts.R still is capable of that option. 
- getblocksnearby() and related functions in EJAM v2.3 will be modified to only optionally use distance adjustment and NOT adjust by default, thus removing the need for an area column in blockwts and likely conforming to EJScreen more exactly. The new parameter use_unadjusted_distance=FALSE will control this. 
- Need to adjust/add unit testing of this change. Need to ensure getblocks diagnostics functions etc. are not messed up by this.
- The datacreate_blockwts script will default to using the weights file that was provided without area and setting area to zero as a placeholder so effective radius is zero but that wont be used by default.",,,https://api.github.com/repos/USEPA/EJAM/issues/144/comments,11/19/2023,8/8/2024,ejanalysis,ejanalysis,0,0,0,FALSE

EJScreen uses precalculated proximity scores that summarize, for each blockgroup in the whole nation, the proximity to and number of nearby facilities of a specific type, like the RMP proximity indicator, as documented in EJScreen Tech. Doc. EJAM should have a function that creates a proximity score for every block group based on proximities of a user-specified list of facilities, calculated just like EJScreen did for RMP, TSDF, NPL sites. A draft function that was starting to work on this was called EJAM:::proxistat2() but one could start over from scratch if that is useful.  The tool would also need to create the lookup tables of percentiles to be used in reporting in terms of percentiles. That can be done via EJAM::pctiles_lookup_create() 

1. create/finish/test a function that can create a proximity score for some or all of the US blockgroups
2. provide the scores via API, so a user can specify ""proximity facilities"" as site points and get back a proximity score for every US blockgroup, or a subset like just in one state.
3. make that proximity score calculation available via web app EJAM - so user can specify points, ask for proximity score, and 
    - download that score for the whole US (every bg), OR 
    - specify two sets of points - the ""proximity facilities"" and the analyzed places (the usual EJAM sites) - EJAM would find blocks nearby the analyzed places as usual, but then calculate an EJScreen-style proximity score for those blocks based on the proximities of the ""proximity facilities"" - and then use that new score as a new indicator to aggregate in doaggregate. This would allow a user to say they want to analyze residents near refineries, eg., and see their envt scores near each refinery but also see the scores representing to what extent they have CAFOs nearby, or parks nearby, or whatever ""proximity facilities"" were specified by the user. 

It must correctly handle the formula EJScreen uses to adjust small distances based on something like blockwts$block_radius_miles

 that had been in the repo of the package called  EJAMblockdata but that repo is gone now/ retired. )","There is a need for this. Started working on it via updates to proxistat() -- latest is now in `proxistat-new` branch.

 Needs supporting functions drafted like indexpoints() etc. but need to resolve whether using getblocksnearby() that is made more flexible or use a dedicated overlapping function like getpointsnearby() or what. Careful not to mess up getblocksnearby() while making it more flexible. |Confirmed on 2/28/24 via email that EJScreen will limit proximity score calculations to 10 kilometers max distance, so a block gets a score of zero if not even one facility/point is within 10 km of block internal point, and block group gets score of zero if not even one point is within 10km of any block points among those blocks in the block group. So any search for nearest one should stop at 10km.|Features to build:
- Provide these kinds of proximity scores (variants)
  - **Proximity Score** like EJScreen has (sum of 1/d values of blocks in BG), etc.
  - **Count Nearby:** The number of places (points) that are within X distance of anyone in the block group.\
  - **Density Score**: Same as count nearby, but expressed in units of count per square mile, within X miles, but need to clarify how to calculate it since it is easy if you pick just one point to represent the block group and count all within 1 mile of that point and divide by sq miles which is pi x R^2 or 3.14 sq miles, say. But if you count all within X miles of any person within the whole BG then it is not obvious what the square miles number should be and whether we mean distance from any edge of the BG (which is more like the new proximity score method in EJScreen 2.3) or distance from any block centroid which is faster and more similar to v.2.2 proximity scores.
- **UPLOAD PLACES**: 1st provide ability to upload and/or specify sites for the proximity scoring, 
- **PICK PLACE CATEGORY, FROM CURATED LIST(S)**: 2d asap provide curated list of options to pick from just like the facility picking options for analysis in EJAM but for picking sets of facilities to create proximity scores. 
- **PRECALCULATE AND CACHE**: we should store cached proximity scores based on those curated standard options by precalculating them all. So if they pick NAICS xyz, it is already done. If they pick NAICS xyz & also NAICS abc, then think about how those precalculated proximity scores might be combined rather than recalculating for the combined set - that might be possible depending on the proximity or density score and overlaps between facility lists?
- **AMENITIES**: 3d, there is also an interest from OEJECR in ability to create such scores for amenities, like proximity to or density of parks, etc. If a user already has such data as a table of lat/lon coordinates, they can upload it just like a list of facilities for this proximity score tool. But as with facilities, we will want to offer a curated list of a few amenity types, maybe with precalculated proximity scores.
- **TERMINOLOGY**: need to ensure text labels in this tool are agnostic or flexible about ""facility"" versus ""amenity"" so maybe ""points of interest"" is the general term or ""user-specified points"" or ""user-provided points"" or places. Also ensure text / terminology can work for proximity scores based on proximity to polygons not just points.
- **POLYGONS**: need to ensure the first or second version of this can handle proximity to polygons not just points.

### Quick interim fix needed asap

Immediate interim workaround should be to replace those links in all tables with NA (or just link to map not report), when the analysis uses shapefiles!  

### Longterm fix

When you run a shapefile report in EJAM, such as using the testdata ""NJ SEWERSHEDS WITH NEEDS"" files in ""testdata/shapes/NJ Sewersheds/"", the excel spreadsheet of site by site results tries to show the usual column of links to EJScreen reports, but those links as coded do not work for a report on a polygon - the function creating those URLs was designed only to handle a circular buffer report (or a county FIPS also works) in EJScreen. The EJScreen API probably can handle a polygon input but likely must be a more complicated query like POST instead of GET and providing geometry of polygon in query body? Not sure simple URL-encoded query would make sense for that case.  

### Closely related issue - other kinds of FIPS?

As a closely related issue, the EJScreen API may only support fips that are for tract or county, but not State, Place, CBSA, EPA Region, etc., so EJAM should handle those types of FIPS-based analyses by converting those FIPS Census units into polygons/boundaries, and then asking the EJScreen API service for a report on the polygon that is the boundaries of each such Census unit. However, if this is unrealistic to query that service for such large polygons as whole States, then consider not providing that option for units/polygons above some size or of certain categories.

#### There are a few related issues: 
1. **EJAM itself** is a package via golem, unlike most shiny apps, so that creates some special considerations There are pros and cons to this approach. 
2. **Two other EJAM-related source packages**, and all 3 are not on CRAN and not on a public repository as of 11/10/23: [EJAMejscreenapi](https://github.com/USEPA/EJAMejscreenapi) and [EJAMbatch.summarizer](https://github.com/USEPA/EJAMbatch.summarizer)  But removing dependency on those entirely is slightly tricky since we would need to ensure the essential functions and data are still available, and because some code or documentation referring to those packages by name would have to be globally updated. There are pros and cons. It is useful to keep some data or code separate, maybe, but worth weighing pros and cons. If nobody ever uses any of them without the others, the only advantage to splitting them is maybe rebuilding one may be faster.
3. **DESCRIPTION file Depends vs Imports**: Any packages needed should be carefully treated via roxygen2 notes indicating they should be in Imports or Depends or Suggests parts of the DESCRIPTION file. 
4. The **data.table** package in particular and also **shiny** and **magrittr** seem to need special treatment and least during development work, so that data.table syntax will work during development, so the app will work, and so the magrittr pipe will work, without having to use library() during development work. 
5. **Too many packages?** EJAM requires dozens of other R packages as of 11/11/2023, and there would be some benefits to reducing the number needed. R CMD check warns about this.
6. **Identifying dependencies:** There are various methods of checking package dependencies, and they do not always agree 100%. Deployment from RStudio to the connect server now uses rsconnect and renv packages (and previously it used to use the packrat package) to try to figure out what R packages are needed for the app to work. But there are other ways of trying to check, noted below.

Shiny apps are limited by R's single-threaded nature. So if one user has a session where they are analyzing large amounts of data, it could prevent EJAM from being able to create graphics for another user, until the first, longer process is done. Since we have some large datasets and slow processing functions, this may become a problem as EJAM gets used by more people over time.

Asynchronous (or async) programming offers a way to offload large computations to another R process and let the ""main"" process continue working while they. This involves use of the {future} and {promises} packages, which can be combined with Shiny. However, they do not pass and return data easily (they use a ""promise"" of a data frame rather than the actual data), so this would require a fair amount of refactoring of our data pipeline.

enhancement: it would be neat and kind of informative to interactively immediately see the map change to show new points (& new sites count in box) as you scroll through the pulldown of MACT or EPA Program categories - maybe that could be fast via caching every possible map (one per category), or some tricky approach possibly more memory-efficient but less speedy like caching a full map of ALL points and filtering to show only the relevant ones as you hover over categories. You could simplify to ignore radius and overlaps etc etc during that hovering preview, and only do those extra map refinements when a category is actually picked. If this could be done for NAICS and SIC that would be nice too, noting the counts are bigger and the yes/no subcategory button matters there.

**Ideas**
- I'm not sure that R Shiny has the ability to update its input values only on hover. However, there may be a way to scroll through once one is clicked on using up and down arrow keys - TBD.
- We can still explore caching maps - or at least pre-processed datasets - for these categorical site selection options. That may cut down on time needed to display these maps when users are switching between NAICS codes quickly, for example.",,,https://api.github.com/repos/USEPA/EJAM/issues/94/comments,11/8/2023,10/9/2024,mlfurman3,none,0,0,0,FALSE

This is problematic if a group with a large number of sites is accidentally selected or is the default selection. This is related to https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM/issues/72 because the slowness of the processing creates additional lag time.

We need a way to check during the initial data processing whether the inputs have changed and, if so, create a way to abort the previous selection and start the new one. Unsure if this should be a backend behavior, or if we need a button to interrupt the huge batch and a warning modal to confirm.

From Mark:
when you give up and pick a different one, even a small category, it still takes a while - not sure if it is trying to finish the long query first?

- [**Functions** are one key way to move code out of server](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-functions.html#server-functions). There are many chunks of script inside reactives, download handlers, etc. that _should get turned into functions_ that can be stored in separate source files. Note that tricky part is to be sure to handle reactives such that either the function relies only on non-reactive parameters and ideally no global variables;  or you just  code the functions in a way that lets the server pass reactives to the functions as parameters. The syntax is a bit tricky - when to use parentheses on the reactive and when no parens. Books and ref docs on shiny explain this clearly with examples.

- [Modules ](https://www.appsilon.com/post/r-shiny-modules) (and see [modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html)) are another way to do this. 

- Moving code out of `app_ui.R `is less critical - mostly useful if there is something repeated many times and that could be replaced with a function.

This would be useful and is a common user need. 

One solution that should be explored and probably implemented is storing the table of distances obtained from EJAM::getblocksnearby() which would save info on full distribution of distances, and then having UI/functions to let user query same points at different distance and get results immediately from doaggregate() applied to the same distances table but with a new cutoff distance – It would run doaggregate() again, but not have to run getblocksnearby() again. The simplest is to let user redo query with same points but new distance. 

A more useful but later solution would be to let them specify 2 or more distances up front and also to have standard summary tables that show results for the 2 or 3 distances in one table, to make clear how demographics and envt conditions may be different within 1 mile than within 5 miles, for example. Right now the results tables are all designed to show results for only 1 distance, so it would need new tables and graphics to be designed. Note the related ideas in #7 continuous distance versus this issue that is about 2 or 3 discreate distances. 

Also, expert users should be able to download the distances table and later analyze it for any set of distance cutpoints.

See the OW code in https://github.com/adamtheising/EJSCREENBatch or https://github.com/USEPA/EJSCREENBatch (not sure which is further ahead) and the NCEE/OP code MC can provide a copy of. They both have code to do areal apportionment of either raster grid cells or of block groups (I think).
