#  https://usepa.github.io/EJAM   etc. documentation webpages via pkgdown and github pages:
#  taken offline 1st. then revising terminology, then might republish from same url/repo
#  or else from EJAM-open or elsewhere may wish to host it,
#  and note/ consider the redirection tools in pkgdown or start over.
#  
# ## To move the documentation website (pkgdown gh pages), 
# would need to edit/check all these:
# CONTRIBUTING.md, DESCRIPTION, NEWS.md, CITATION, global.R, plumber.R,
# EJAM-package.R, aaa_onAttach.R, ejamit.R, README.Rmd/.md,
# _pkgdown.yml,  vignettes,
# long_report_template..., manifest.json or script creating it,
# etc. and saved open issues comments.
## and redo  EJAM/data-raw/datacreate_0_UPDATE_ALL_DOCUMENTATION_pkgdown.R


# https://rstudio-connect.dmap-stage.aws.epa.gov  in dataload_from_pins() or checking if avail.,
#       referring to pins board that is internal-only/ nonpublic.
#  leave as is for now with comment about internal only? pkg seems to work without access to it
# as long as installation process is 
# able to obtain the arrow files from USEPA/ejamdata repo
