# Executive Summary

EPA has conducted an analysis to characterize baseline environmental
conditions faced by communities living near `r params$sectorname_short`.
   or 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) analyzed
baseline residential population and environmental conditions in communities living
`r params$within_x_miles_of` selected sites.

The analysis used EPA's EJAM tool version `r params$ejscreen_version` with
demographic data based on the Census Bureau's `r params$acs_version`
American Community Survey (ACS).

# Introduction





# Methods

## Selection of sites analyzed

This analysis focused on locations categorized under `r params$sectorname_short`. The latitude
and longitude of a point representing each site was obtained from
`r params$source_of_latlons`. A total of `r params$sitecount` sites had
location information and were analyzed.

## Map of Analyzed Sites

Figure \@ref(fig:map-sites) shows a map of the sites analyzed.

```{r map-sites, fig.cap = "\\label{map-sites}Map of Analyzed Sites", echo=FALSE,  out.height='280px', out.width='600px'}
  
if (params$testmode) {
  knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$map_placeholder_png)
} else {
  # params$map
  knitr::include_graphics(rel_path = TRUE, path = params$map)
}

```

## Estimating locations and residential population counts

The Environmental and Residential Population Analysis Multisite tool was used to
develop this analysis. The [multisite
tool](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/index.html "Environmental and Residential Population Analysis Multisite tool")
is a user-friendly web app that can summarize residential population and
environmental conditions for any list of places in the nation.

### Spatial resolution of data

The analysis used EPA's EJAM tool version
`r params$ejscreen_version` with residential population data based on the Census
Bureau's `r params$acs_version` American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year
summary file, and the corresponding version of Decennial Census
information on geographic boundaries and FIPS codes for blocks, block
groups, tracts, counties, and states. Residential population and environmental
indicators were at block group resolution. Locations of
residential populations were at block resolution (the highest resolution
available from the Census Bureau) and then summarized by block group. Once
site locations are input to EJAM, the residential populations are
then analyzed by location, and then summarized as percentiles and averages
across all sites input to EJAM. 

See [EJScreen
methodology](https://web.archive.org/web/20250118193121/https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/technical-information-and-data-downloads)
for details.

### Analytic method for buffering, and tools used to implement that method

The basic methodology and data used for this analysis are the same as
those used in EPA's EJScreen tool, with a few exceptions described
below, and are described in detail in EJScreen's documentation, at
[EJScreen](https://epa.gov/ejscreen "EPA EJScreen homepage"){.uri
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and with more technical
details available at [EJScreen technical documentation
page](https://web.archive.org/web/20250118072723/https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/technical-information-and-data-downloads "EPA EJScreen technical information"){.uri
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

EJAM identifies residents near a given site by finding
which Census block points are nearby and counts the full block
population if that point is nearby. The percentage of each block
group's population that is estimated as inside a buffer is based on
which Census block internal points are included in the buffer and
using a block weight. The block weight is the Census 2020 block population as a
fraction of the parent block group's Census 2020 population (which is
not quite the same as the ACS population count). That block weight is a
fraction of the parent block group and is used to estimate how many of
the block groups residents are nearby or in the buffer.

The only notable differences between the EJScreen and EJAM calculations
of proximity and indicators are the following:

-   EJAM may include additional residential population or environmental indicators.
-   For a proximity analysis (to characterize everyone living within a
    certain certain distance from a point such as a facility), EJAM
    identifies which residents live nearby using a slight variation on
    how the distance to each Census block is measured. While EJScreen
    uses ESRI's ArcGIS calculations, EJAM calculates the distance using
    formulas implemented in the R language for statistical computing
    [@R-base]. These measurements provide almost identical results for
    estimated distance from the average person in a block to a given
    site point.
-   EJAM aggregates indicator values within and across locations,
    converts them to percentiles, and performs other summary calculations
    using the same formulas as EJScreen to the greatest extent possible, but in R
    rather than within EJScreen itself. There may be slight differences
    between raw scores and percentiles in EJScreen and EJAM in some
    cases.

## Demographic and environmental indicators

The residential population indicators included in EJAM are the same as those in EJScreen.
People of Color (POC) are defined as all other than those
self-identifying in ACS survey data as white, single race, not Hispanic
or Latino - i.e., non-Hispanic white alone ("NHWA"). The subgroups include
Hispanic or Latino ("hispanic"), several groups that are not Hispanic
but of only single race (e.g., Asian, or more specifically non-Hispanic
Asian alone), non-Hispanic other single race, and non-Hispanic
multiracial.

The environmental indicators included in EJAM are the same as those in EJScreen. 

See [EJScreen
methodology](https://web.archive.org/web/20250118193121/https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/technical-information-and-data-downloads)
for details.

# Findings

## Summary of results

Table \@ref(tab:summary-table) shows a few summary characteristics of
the locations analyzed. Out of `r params$site_count` sites analyzed,
`r tot_pop` residents are
accounted for `r params$within_x_miles_of` the site geolocation.
“Percent population accounted for at 10% of facilities” represents the
share of population of all sites that is represented by the 10% of sites
that have the highest population. The “Population living within radius
of at least 2 facilities” is the number of people that live within the
radius of at least 2 facilities.

## Residential population indicator results

In EJAM, values are compared to state or national average and presented as a
ratio. This ratio is used as an indicator to detect any overrepresented
populations living within the radius of sites.

To detect increased potential impact, demographic population percentages
locally are compared to state and national averages. The ratio
between the local and state averages and the ratio between local and
national averages are used as a reference to detect potential disparity.
Out of the demographic indicators and sites analyzed, the greatest ratio compared to the
state average is `r demog_ind$max_overall_st` with a rato value of
`r demog_ind$max_overall_val_st`.

An above average percentage for any demographic indicator is any ratio
greater than one. For the facilities analyzed,
`r demog_ind$count_1.01_st` demographic indicators were calculated on
average to be greater than 1.01 times the state average for each
indicator. `r demog_ind$pct_fac_1.01_st` The maximum demographic
indicators above 1.01 times the state average for any one facility is
`r demog_ind$max_count_1.01_st`.

For more highly overrepresented populations, the ratio will be much greater
than the average, such as more than two times or more than three times.
For the facilities analyzed, `r demog_ind$count_2_st` residential population
indicators were calculated on average to be greater than two times the
state average for each indicator. `r demog_ind$ind_names2_text_st`
`r demog_ind$pct_fac_2_st` The maximum residential population indicators above 2
times the state average for any one facility is
`r demog_ind$max_count_2_st`. `r demog_ind$ind_names35_text_st`

Additionally, facilities can have increased exposure on certain
residential populations based on the population contained within the
`r params$distance`. `r demog_ind$poppct_ind_abv2_st`% of the population
analyzed live near facilities above the two times threshold, and
`r demog_ind$poppct_ind_abv3_st`% of the population `r params$where` a
facility three times above the state average.

Similar to state average comparisons, the comparison to national
averages provides additional insights on population characteristics.
When compared to the national average, the demographic indicator with
the greatest ratio is `r demog_ind$max_overall_us` with a value of
`r demog_ind$max_overall_val_us`.

For the facilities analyzed, `r demog_ind$count_1.01_us` demographic
indicators were calculated to be greater than 1.01 times the national
average for each indicator. `r demog_ind$pct_fac_1.01_us` The maximum
demographic indicators above 1.01 times the state average for any one
facility is `r demog_ind$max_count_1.01_us`.

`r demog_ind$count_2_us` demographic indicators were calculated to be
greater than two times the national average for each indicator.
`r demog_ind$ind_names2_text_us` `r demog_ind$pct_fac_2_us` The maximum
demographic indicators above 2 times the state average for any one
facility is `r demog_ind$max_count_2_us`.

`r demog_ind$ind_names35_text_us`

`r demog_ind$poppct_ind_abv2_us`% of the population analyzed live near
facilities above the two times threshold, and
`r demog_ind$poppct_ind_abv3_us`% of the population `r params$where` a
facility three times above the national average.

### Data Table. Demographic Indicators

Table \@ref(tab:demog-table) shows key results for the analysis of
demographics in these locations. The table shows each demographic
group's share of the residential population in these locations and
compares that to their shares of statewide and nationwide population.

Based on the analysis, `r demog_ind$ind_fac_2_name` has the most
facilities with values two times greater than the state average
(`r demog_ind$ind_fac_2_count`). `r demog_ind$ind_fac_2_pct`% of the
population is included in this estimate.

`r demog_ind$ind_fac_3_name` has the most facilities with values three
times greater than the state average (`r demog_ind$ind_fac_3_count`).
`r demog_ind$ind_fac_3_pct`% of the population is included in this
estimate.

`r demog_ind$ind_fac_5_name` has the most facilities with values five
times greater than the state average (`r demog_ind$ind_fac_5_count`).
`r demog_ind$ind_fac_5_pct`% of the population is included in this
estimate.

The largest disparity for a group/indicator indicates
over-representation of that group. For relative disparity,
`r demog_ind$rel_disp_name` has the largest difference of local
percentage compared to U.S. percentage. The state level
(`r demog_ind$rel_disp_st$value`) is `r demog_ind$rel_disp_qualifier`
the national level (`r demog_ind$rel_disp_us$value`) by
`r demog_ind$rel_disp$value`.

`r demog_ind$ind_pctile_90_st_text` `r demog_ind$ind_pctile_90_us_text`
`r demog_ind$ind_pctile_80_st_text` `r demog_ind$ind_pctile_80_us_text`

`r demog_ind$ind_pctile_st_name` had the largest max mean percentile
with a value of `r demog_ind$ind_pctile_st_val` at the state level.
`r demog_ind$ind_pctile_us_name` had the largest max mean percentile
with a value of `r demog_ind$ind_pctile_us_val` at the national level.

`r demog_ind$max_overall_us` had the largest ratio to the U.S. average,
and `r demog_ind$max_overall_st` had the largest ratio when compared to
the state average. The values for these ratios are
`r demog_ind$max_overall_val_us` and `r demog_ind$max_overall_val_st`
respectively.

The largest single ratio compared to state average out of all facilities
was for `r demog_ind$max_ratio_st_name` with the value
`r demog_ind$max_ratio_st_val`. This facility impacts
`r demog_ind$max_ratio_st_pop_pct`% of the total population.

The largest single ratio compared to national average out of all
facilities was for `r demog_ind$max_ratio_us_name` with the value
`r demog_ind$max_ratio_us_val`. This facility impacts
`r demog_ind$max_ratio_us_pop_pct`% of the total population.

`r demog_ind$key_sites_count` key sites have over half of demographic
indicators more than 2x the US average. There are 10 demographic
indicators included in EJAM, and therefore, over half represents over 5
indicators. These key sites represent `r demog_ind$key_sites_pop_pct`%
of the total population.

Overall, the greatest ratio compared to the state average is
`r envt_ind$max_overall_st` with a value of
`r envt_ind$max_overall_val_st`.

For the facilities analyzed, `r envt_ind$count_1.01_st` environmental
indicators were calculated on average to be greater than 1.01 times the
state average for each indicator. `r envt_ind$pct_fac_1.01_st` The
maximum environmental indicators above 1.01 times the state average for
any one facility is `r envt_ind$max_count_1.01_st`.

For the facilities analyzed, `r envt_ind$count_2_st` environmental
indicators were calculated on average to be greater than two times the
state average for each indicator. `r envt_ind$ind_names2_text_st`
`r envt_ind$pct_fac_2_st` The maximum environmental indicators above 2
times the state average for any one facility is
`r envt_ind$max_count_2_st`.

`r envt_ind$ind_names35_text_st`

`r envt_ind$poppct_ind_abv2_st`% of the population analyzed live near
facilities above the two times threshold, and
`r envt_ind$poppct_ind_abv3_st`% of the population `r params$where` a
facility three times above the state average.

Overall, the greatest ratio compared to the national average is
`r envt_ind$max_overall_us` with a value of
`r envt_ind$max_overall_val_us`.

For the facilities analyzed, `r envt_ind$count_1.01_us` environmental
indicators were calculated to be greater than 1.01 times the national
average for each indicator. `r envt_ind$pct_fac_1.01_us` The maximum
environmental indicators above 1.01 times the state average for any one
facility is `r envt_ind$max_count_1.01_us`.

For the facilities analyzed, `r envt_ind$count_2_us` environmental
indicators were calculated to be greater than two times the national
average for each indicator. `r envt_ind$ind_names2_text_us`
`r envt_ind$pct_fac_2_us` The maximum environmental indicators above 2
times the state average for any one facility is
`r envt_ind$max_count_2_us`.

`r envt_ind$ind_names35_text_us`

`r envt_ind$poppct_ind_abv2_us`% of the population analyzed live near
facilities above the two times threshold, and
`r envt_ind$poppct_ind_abv3_us`% of the population `r params$where` a
facility three times above the national average.

### Data Table. Summary of Environmental Indicators

Table \@ref(tab:envt-table) shows key results for the analysis of
environmental metrics in these locations. The table shows each
environmental indicators' share of the residential population in these
locations and compares that to their shares of statewide and nationwide
population.

Based on the analysis, `r envt_ind$ind_fac_2_name` has the most
facilities with values two times greater than the state average
(`r envt_ind$ind_fac_2_count`). `r envt_ind$ind_fac_2_pct`% of the
population is included in this estimate.

`r envt_ind$ind_fac_3_name` has the most facilities with values three
times greater than the state average (`r envt_ind$ind_fac_3_count`).
`r envt_ind$ind_fac_3_pct`% of the population is included in this
estimate.

`r envt_ind$ind_fac_5_name` has the most facilities with values five
times greater than the state average (`r envt_ind$ind_fac_5_count`).
`r envt_ind$ind_fac_5_pct`% of the population is included in this
estimate.

The largest disparity for a indicator indicates over-representation of
that indicator. For relative disparity, `r envt_ind$rel_disp_name` has
the largest difference of local percentage compared to U.S. percentage.
The state level (`r envt_ind$rel_disp_st$value`) is
`r envt_ind$rel_disp_qualifier` the national level
(`r envt_ind$rel_disp_us$value`) by `r envt_ind$rel_disp$value`.

`r envt_ind$ind_pctile_90_us_text`

`r envt_ind$ind_pctile_80_st_text`

`r envt_ind$ind_pctile_80_us_text`

`r envt_ind$ind_pctile_st_name` had the largest max mean percentile with
a value of `r envt_ind$ind_pctile_st_val` at the state level.
`r envt_ind$ind_pctile_us_name` had the largest max mean percentile with
a value of `r envt_ind$ind_pctile_us_val` at the national level.

Overall, `r envt_ind$max_overall_us` had the largest ratio to the U.S.
average, and `r envt_ind$max_overall_st` had the largest ratio when
compared to the state average. The values for these ratios are
`r envt_ind$max_overall_val_us` and `r envt_ind$max_overall_val_st`

The largest single ratio compared to state average out of all facilities
was for `r envt_ind$max_ratio_st_name` with the value
`r envt_ind$max_ratio_st_val`. This facility impacts
`r envt_ind$max_ratio_st_pop_pct`% of the total population.

The largest single ratio compared to national average out of all
facilities was for `r envt_ind$max_ratio_us_name` with the value
`r envt_ind$max_ratio_us_val`. This facility impacts
`r envt_ind$max_ratio_us_pop_pct`% of the total population.

`r envt_ind$key_sites_count` key sites have over half of environmental
indicators more than 2x the US average. There are 10 environmental
indicators included in EJAM, and therefore, over half represents over 5
indicators. These key sites represent `r envt_ind$key_sites_pop_pct`% of
the total population.

A summary index here is a metric for the combination of
environmental and residential population characteristics. Out of 13 summary indicators,
the largest 3 state percentiles for EJ are as follows:

-    `r ej_ind$st_pctile_1_name` (`r ej_ind$st_pctile_1_val`)

-   `r ej_ind$st_pctile_2_name` (`r ej_ind$st_pctile_2_val`)

-    `r ej_ind$st_pctile_3_name` (`r ej_ind$st_pctile_3_val`)

The largest 3 national percentiles for EJ are as follows:

-   `r ej_ind$us_pctile_1_name` (`r ej_ind$us_pctile_1_val`)

-   `r ej_ind$us_pctile_2_name` (`r ej_ind$us_pctile_2_val`)

-   `r ej_ind$us_pctile_3_name` (`r ej_ind$us_pctile_3_val`)

-   min
-   min other than zero?
-   mean
-   25^th^ %ile of these sites or people (25% have lower than this, and
    75% have higher than this -- those are same if no ties with this
    value, but can differ if multiple places have this same exact
    indicator score)
-   median (half of these sites or people have a score that is \>= this,
    and half have \<= this)
-   75^th^ %ile of these sites or people (if a tied value, would want
    both \>75 and \<25%)

    threshold?**

    -   \# of sites w data where \>=1

    -   \# of sites w data where \>1 not =1

    -   \# of sites w data where \>=4

## Appendix 4 - notes on how to describe places generically/ in parameters

HOW TO REFER TO THE PLACES STUDIED (near these facilities vs more
general language)

Note: this could be a "proximity analysis" in cases where it relies on
circular buffers around facility points to define buffers that include
residents within a fixed distance from one or more facilities/sites. But
it more generally could be an EJ analysis that describes environmental
and demographic conditions among residents in any specified places, such
as all the places where air quality modeling suggests risk is currently
above 1 in 1 million, for example. So the language should be flexible
and refer to something like this:

FOR NON-PROXIMITY ANALYSIS, GENERALLY ANY KIND OF BUFFERS/PLACES
ANALYZED:

The demographics of residents in ...

The demographic / environmental indicators in ...

Percent low income among residents in ...

The environmental conditions in ...

The environmental indicators for the average resident in ...

The PM2.5 levels in ...

Residents in ...

... these locations

... these places

... these areas

... the analyzed locations

FOR PROXIMITY ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY, EASIER TO SAY one of these:

Residents / conditions ...

... within x miles of these sites...

... within x miles of any of these sites...

... nearby

... near these sites

... near any of these sites

## Notes on formatting for a manuscript

This manuscript will follow the guidelines in the Guide for Authors of
the relevant journal. For detailed instructions on the elsevier
article class, see
<https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions>

## Bibliography styles

Here are two sample references: [@Feynman1963118; @Dirac1953888]. 

By default, natbib will be used with the `authoryear` style, set in the 
`classoption` variable in a YAML. 
You can set  extra options with 
`natbiboptions` variable in a YAML header:
#``` yaml
#natbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon
#```

There are various more specific bibliography styles available at
<https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files>.
To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example,
`biblio-style: model1-num-names`.

If `citation_package` is set to `default` in `elsevier_article()`, then
pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`.
